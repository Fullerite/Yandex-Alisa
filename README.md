This is a skill for Yandex's voice assistant â€” Alisa(Alice). It works on every device from Yandex station to Yandex Navigator. 
It will help you by recommending films or TV series, either randomly or by genre you have specified.

## Structure
- Main logic
- NLP (Natural Language Processing) tools
- Auxiliary tools

## Main logic
Skill logic is contained in `main.py`. It's built using if-else statements. 
Small tasks were divided into multiple functions, 
whereas the main processing happens in the `handler()` function, which is responsible for accepting user requests and sending back responses.

## NLP
Natural Language Processing was done using Yandex's intents, which use their own language.

## Auxiliary tools
Auxiliary functions are contained in `api.py`. Content was generated using two Kinopoisk unofficial REST APIs.
Overall, the code was deployed on Yandex's serverless platform.
